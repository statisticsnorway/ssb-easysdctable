Description: The main function, ProtectTable(), performs table suppression according to a 
 frequency rule with a data set as the only required input. Within this function, 
 protectTable(), protect_linked_tables() or runArgusBatchFile() in package 'sdcTable' is called. 
 Lists of level-hierarchy (parameter 'dimList') and other required input to these functions 
 are created automatically. 
 The suppression method Gauss (default) is an additional method that is not available in 'sdcTable'.
 The function, PTgui(), starts a graphical user interface based on the 'shiny' package.
